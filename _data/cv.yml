      year: 2021 - Present
      description:
        - Quantified multi-decadal sediment extraction and land-water change using Google Earth Engine and machine learning to support watershed-scale decision making.
        - Estimated geomorphic disturbance and recovery from gravel mining using remote sensing and field-informed methods.
        - Diagnosed community and land-use impacts of aggregate extraction using mixed-methods fieldwork with riverine stakeholders to inform community-centered watershed planning.
        - Automated monitoring of sediment transport and extraction intensity using deep learning and high-resolution satellite imagery to generate spatio-temporal hotspot metrics.
        - Translated socio-ecological evidence into governance and restoration recommendations.
