**As a scientist**, I use rivers and sediments to explore

* the socio-environmental impacts of sand and gravel mining and how extraction reshapes river corridors,
* how changes in sediment supply alter channel form, incision, and flood risk, and
* spatial patterns of sediment transport and landscape response across scales.

**Currently**, I am quantifying mining-driven morphological change with remote sensing and field measurements, linking those changes to flood vulnerability and community impacts, and developing reproducible tools (GIS + scripts) to monitor extraction and sediment budgets.

I am a **PhD student, Geography & GIS, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign**, and I collaborate with field teams and policy partners to translate results into practical guidance for sustainable river management.

I contribute to open data, reproducible code, and outreach that makes geomorphology useful and accessible.
